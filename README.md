⚔️IRON RESOLUTION⚔️

Iron Resolution is a turn-based tactical roguelike game inspired by Battle Brothers and medieval Memoir 44.

In the game you command a company of unique recruits through 10 deadly campaigns.  Every battle is permanent — injuries linger, morale breaks, and fallen brothers are gone forever.

Recruit new blood between levels. Watch your veterans grow stronger... or fall.
