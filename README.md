⚔️IRON RESOLUTION⚔️

Iron Resolution is a turn-based tactical roguelike game inspired by Battle Brothers and medieval Memoir 44.

In the game you command a company of unique recruits through 5 deadly campaigns.  Every battle is permanent — injuries linger, morale breaks, and fallen brothers are gone forever.

Recruit new blood between levels. Watch your veterans grow stronger... or fall.

Features:

    4 distinct classes with meaningful roles
    Terrain that impacts attack and defence
    Morale system: units can flee or rally
    Injuries that affect stats
    Leveling up with permanent growth
    Persistent company across levels
