 ⚔️IRON RESOLUTION⚔️

WELCOME, SERGEANT!

Iron Resolution is a turn-based tactical roguelike game inspired by Battle Brothers and medieval Memoir 44.

Command a company of unique recruits through 3 deadly campaigns.  Every battle is permanent — injuries linger, morale breaks, and fallen brothers are gone forever.

Recruit new blood between levels. Watch your veterans grow stronger... or fall.

Features:

    4 distinct classes with meaningful roles
    Terrain that impacts attack and defence
    Morale system: units can flee or rally
    Injuries that affect stats
    Leveling up with permanent growth
    Persistent company across levels 

Your soldiers don't just die — they break.

"In war, the will is everything. Today, your will shall be tested."
🎮 HOW TO PLAY

📌 BASIC CONTROLS:

    Click any unit to select it. You control the Blue team. The computer AI controls the Red team
    Click a highlighted tile to move your unit to that tile.
    'A' or click an enemy to attack
    'H' or Click one of your units to heal (Mage only)
    'Esc' or Cancel to cancel the selected unit
    'E' or  End Turn to end your turn

🎯 UNIT CLASSES:

...

Actions: Units have 3 Actions per turn (Mages: 2)
- Moving 1 tile = 1 Action
- Attacking = 1 Action
- Healing = 1 Action
Plan your turn carefully!

 When a unit is selected, its attack range is shown as orange tiles! Move into range, then attack in the same turn.
🔥 COMBAT SYSTEMS

⚔️ WEAPONS & ARMOR: Each unit starts with class-appropriate gear! Swords deal damage, axes penetrate armor, maces can stun, and bows attack from range. Armor reduces incoming damage but may slow you down.

💀 INJURIES & MORALE:

    Take heavy damage? Risk injuries that reduce stats for several turns!
    Watch the morale bar under each unit - low morale reduces accuracy and attack!
    Units can Flee if terrified, but may Rally with nearby allies! 

⭐ LEVELING UP: Units gain XP from dealing damage and defeating enemies. Level up to increase HP, attack, and unlock hidden potential!

Recruit New Units: For gold each time you move up a level!

🧠 BATTLE TIPS

    Positioning is Key: Use forests for cover, avoid water (blocks movement)
    Protect your Mages: They're fragile but can heal your frontline!
    Manage Morale: Keep units together - nearby allies boost morale recovery!
    Focus Fire: Eliminate high-threat enemies first (Mages → Archers → Berserkers → Knights)
    Use Terrain: Mountains give a defense bonus, but reduce accuracy
    Water: It is not possible to pass through water. 

🏆 PROGRESSION SYSTEM

Complete 3 EPIC LEVELS:

    Defend the Village - Training Ground

VERSION

    Added a start-game splash screen to set the scene with basic instructions.
    End of level now shows stats screen, recruitment screen, and story progression screen.
    The enemy mage is now more defensive rather than charging.
    Fixed bug where the enemy would move or attack, but not both.

    Creating a storyline.
        1 Defend the village

    The Knight now has 3 Actions, not 2, as they were a little underpowered.
