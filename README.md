⚔️IRON RESOLUTION⚔️

Iron Resolution is a turn-based tactical roguelike game inspired by Battle Brothers and medieval Memoir 44.

In the game you command a company of unique recruits through 5 deadly campaigns.  Every battle is permanent — injuries linger, morale breaks, and fallen brothers are gone forever.

Recruit new blood between levels. Watch your veterans grow stronger... or fall.

Features:

    4 distinct classes with meaningful roles
    Terrain that impacts attack and defence
    Morale system: units can flee or rally
    Injuries that affect stats
    Leveling up with permanent growth
    Persistent company across levels 

Your soldiers don't just die — they break.

Complete 3 EPIC LEVELS:

    Defend the Village - Training Ground
    Forest pursuit across the river - Face tougher enemies
    Mountain Fortress - Final boss battle! 

Surviving units carry over between levels (with partial healing). 
The fallen are lost forever!
